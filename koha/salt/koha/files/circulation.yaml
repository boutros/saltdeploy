# Staff user
# The borrowernumber of the staff user that will do all our issues. 
# We will change the branch affailiation of this user dynamically, 
# but it needs to be the borrowernumber of a staff user with circ
# permissions.

# Per user - Not implemented yet! 
# Max number of issues a borrower can make in one day
max_issues_per_day_per_borrower: 4
min_issues_per_day_per_borrower: 1

# Maximum and minimum issues that should be made in a day
# This should account for your daily averages, and can be 
# modified based on week of the year and/or day of the
# week with the settings further down in this file

min_issues_per_day: 3
max_issues_per_day: 7

# If you are generating statistics that span more than one year, 
# you can change the frequency of issues on a year by year basis.
# List the years you want to differ from the average here, along
# with the percentage of the difference. (You probably want to 
# keep these numbers close to 100.)

years: 
  2008: 93
  2009: 96
  2010: 98

# If there are weeks where you want the number of issues to 
# be different than the average max and mins defined above
# you can list them here, along with a change in number of
# issues given as a percentage. If you want a busy week with
# twice the number of issues you give it a percentage of 200
# and a slow week with half the number of issues gets a 
# percentage of 50. 
# You only need to list the weeks that should differ from 
# the average here! 

weeks: 
  1: 75
  9: 75

  19: 50
  20: 10
  52: 10

# This works similar to weeks, slow days of the week get
# a low percentage (below 100), weeks with more issues than
# average get a high percentage (above 100). Only days that
# should differ from the average need to be listed here.
